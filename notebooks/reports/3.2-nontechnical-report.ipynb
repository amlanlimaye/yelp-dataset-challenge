    "Yelp is an American multinational corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California. It develops, hosts and markets Yelp.com and the Yelp mobile app, which publish crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses, as well as the online reservation service Yelp Reservations and online food-delivery service Eat24. The company also trains small businesses in how to respond to reviews, hosts social events for reviewers, and provides data about businesses, including health inspection scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yelp.com is a crowd-sourced local business review and social networking site. Its user community is primarily active in major metropolitan areas.The site has pages devoted to individual locations, such as restaurants or schools, where Yelp users can submit a review on their products or services using a one to five star rating system.Businesses can also update contact information, hours and other basic listing information or add special deals. In addition to writing reviews, users can react to reviews, plan events or discuss their personal lives. According to Sterling Market Intelligence, Yelp is \"one of the most important sites on the Internet.\" As of Q2 2016 it has 168 million monthly unique visitors and 108 million reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "78 percent of businesses listed on the site have a rating of three stars or better, but some negative reviews are very personal or extreme. Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner. Users can give a review a \"thumbs-up\" if it is \"useful, funny or cool.\" Each day a \"Review of the Day\" is determined based on a vote by users.\n"

    "The objective of this project is to unearth the \"topics\" being talked about in Yelp Reviews, understand their distribution and develop an understanding of Yelp Reviews that will serve as a foundation to tackle more sophisticated questions in the future, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Cultural Trends: What makes a particular city different? What cuisines do Yelpers rave about in different countries? Do Americans tend to eat out late compared to those in Germany or the U.K.? In which countries are Yelpers sticklers for service quality? In international cities such as Montreal, are French speakers reviewing places differently than English speakers?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Inferring Categories: Are there any non-intuitive correlations between business categories e.g., how many karaoke bars also offer Korean food, and vice versa? What businesses deserve their own subcategory (i.e., Szechuan or Hunan versus just \"Chinese restaurants\")\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Detecting Sarcasm in Reviews: Are Yelpers a sarcastic bunch?\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Detecting Changepoints and Events: Detecting when things change suddenly (e.g., a business coming under new management or when a city starts going nuts over cronuts)"

    "A topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract \"topics\" that occur in a collection of documents. A document typically concerns multiple topics in different proportions; thus, in a document that is 10% about cats and 90% about dogs, there would probably be about 9 times more dog words than cat words. The \"topics\" produced by topic modeling techniques are clusters of similar words. A topic model captures this intuition in a mathematical framework, which allows examining a set of documents and discovering, based on the statistics of the words in each, what the topics might be and what each document's balance of topics is.\n",

    "....First picking a topic (according to the multinomial distribution that you sampled above; for example, you might pick the food topic with 1/3 probability and the cute animals topic with 2/3 probability).\n",
    "....Then using the topic to generate the word itself (according to the topic's multinomial distribution). For instance, the food topic might output the word \"broccoli\" with 30% probability, \"bananas\" with 15% probability, and so on.\n",

The huge size of the data, 400K reviews is definitely a challenge, but I'm optimistic on being able to do that soon.\n",

Do Americans tend to eat out late compared to those in Germany or the U.K.? In which countries are Yelpers sticklers for service quality? In international cities such as Montreal, are French speakers reviewing places differently than English speakers?\n",
